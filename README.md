# Are cards in "Magic: the Gathering" getting better?

This is a medium-sized personal project for me to practice some Data Science concepts I am currently learning.

In this project there will be some Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and Visualization.

## Goal
Analyse the Power-Creep (increase in effectiveness) over the years in Magic: The Gathering, a collectible card game.

## Files
- Data Cleaning.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing the documented first part of the project. It starts with a lot more context and explanation on the concept of the project.
- Analysis & Visualization.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing the documented second part of the project.
- sets_summary.csv: the result of the Data Cleaning. It contains summary data on the effectiveness of creatures for each selected set.
- effectiveness_over_time.pdf: final plot of the project. You can open it directly from GitHub.
