# Are cards in "Magic: the Gathering" getting better?

Work in Progress.

This is a small personal project for me to practice some Data Science concepts I am currently learning.

In this project there will be some Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and Visualization.

## Goal
Analyse the power-creep (increase in effectiveness) over the years in Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game.

#### Please check the notebook file "MTG - Creature Power-Creep.ipynb" for more explanation, documentation, and the code for the Data Cleaning part.
