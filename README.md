# Data Science: MTG Power-Creep

Work in Progress.

This is a small personal project for me to practice some Data Science concepts I am currently learning.

## Goal
Analyse the power-creep (increase in effectiveness) over the years in Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game.
To simplify, I chose to narrow the cards down to the draftable core set creatures, as they, in my opinion, are the easiest ones to measure power-creep with.
I will focus on the evolution of the relation between the mana cost of a creature and its stats (power + toughness).
